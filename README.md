#### About Me
 I am an engineer with strong design skills.  I love working on interesting products and thrive on developing products that works end to end.  I like the evolving of "Web Technologies" with Javascript being able to push the envelope of modern web.  ```Javascript``` lead the way for me from being an avid advocate of "Strongly Typed" languages from the likes of `C#`, `Java` etc.

Page Composer Framework is an extension modularizing web app development for Ebay pages.  This framework separates the concern and identifies Page WireFrame, Modules construct the data stream and the UI Component capable of rendering the module.

The consuming application will provide the URL pattern to the `Page Composer Framework` and render the page.
