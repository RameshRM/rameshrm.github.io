#### About Me
 I am an engineer with strong design skills.  I love working on interesting products and thrive on developing products that works end to end.  I like the evolving of "Web Technologies" with Javascript being able to push the envelope of modern web.  ```Javascript``` lead the way for me from being an avid advocate of "Strongly Typed" languages from the likes of `C#`, `Java` etc.

* [Typewriter](https://github.com/RameshRM/typewriter)  

`TypeWriter` obviously refers to the keyboard.  This is a Javascript library to capture and abstract the keyboard specific eventing for DOM. This library is created from the inspiration of accessibility for the web and "Github.com" enabling to type and search from the Web UI.  

'TypeWriter` library abstracts the keyboard eventing from your DOM specific event binding, also provides easy access to bind to multiple keyboard events easily.

* [Cross Domain XHR](https://github.com/ebay/crossdomain-xhr)

`Cross Domain XHR` is a library to abstract `XMLHttpRequest` calls from your browser.  You might think why do we need a new library for XMLHttpReuest, where in the likes of jQuery exists.  The core problem this library addresses is "Cross Domain Ajax Requests".  This library provides ability to make standard CORS for supported browsers , for non-supported browsers provide a polyfill of "IFrame PostMessages". The library provides an option for you to choose configuration you want to use for Cross Domain Ajax calls.
