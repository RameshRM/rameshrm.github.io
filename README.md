#### About Me
 I am an engineer with strong design skills.  I love working on interesting products and thrive on developing products that works end to end.  I like the evolving of "Web Technologies" with Javascript being able to push the envelope of modern web.  ```Javascript``` lead the way for me from being an avid advocate of "Strongly Typed" languages from the likes of `C#`, `Java` etc.
